# Intro to Programming in C

## What is in here?

Culmination of all assignments done in C for a introductory programming class at Florida Atlantic University. These were all completed around 2019 to 2020.

## Index

1. Project 1 - Introduction: Basic programming concepts of C, including how to use the compiler and how to print to the console.
2. Project 2 - Input and Math: How to receive input from the user, and how to perform mathematical operations using C.
3. Project 3 - Conditions: Learning flow-control using if-else statements.
4. Project 4 - Loops: Using iteration and looping for performing repetitive/autonomous operations.
5. Project 5 - Review Assignment
6. Project 6 - Functions: Explore abstraction and modularity by putting common code pieces into functions.
7. Project 7 - Strings: Learn how strings (or rather, character arrays) work in C.
8. Project 8 - Review Assignment
9. Project 9 - Structs: How do you create a new datatype in C?
10. Project 10 - Pointers: C is a great language because it gets you as close to memory as possible. Let's learn how to use that effectively.
11. Project 11 - Review Assignment

## Misc-Tests

Have you ever been in a lecture and had this thought pass your mind? "Hey! I wonder what happens if I do it this way!" Well, that's what this folder is full of. Random ideas I had during classes and decided I needed to find out exactly what would happen if I implemented them.

TLDR: Experiments, lots and lots of experiments.
